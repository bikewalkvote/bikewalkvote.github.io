## Contribute!

Campaigns run on two fuels: money and volunteers.

We need your financial support, which allows us to print materials, run the organization, and reach voters. Oregon has a unique state law that allows the first $50 from individuals, and the first $100 from couples filing jointly, to qualify for a political tax credit. Give us $50, get $50 back at tax time. Learn more about it on <a href="http://oregontaxcredit.com/" title="about the Oregon Political Tax Credit">on an easy to read site</a> or read the <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/DOR/PERTAX/2009_piti/credits_political_contributions.shtml" title="Oregon's department of revenue on political contributions">full tax law</a>.

We also need your volunteer time to help build our organization and elect the candidates we endorse. To volunteer please email us at <a href="mailto:team@bikewalkvote.org?subject=I want to volunteer!" title="volunteer for bike walk vote">team@bikewalkvote.org.</a>
