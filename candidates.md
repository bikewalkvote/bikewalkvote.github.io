Check back here each election season for Bike Walk Vote's endorsements!

## Our Endorsement Process

Bike Walk Vote PAC makes endorsements based on answers to written
questionnaires, a review of public documents and forums, personal knowledge
and experience, and interviews as necessary.  If there is a candidate you think
we should consider or have questions you'd like us to ask,
[let us know](mailto:bikewalkvote@gmail.com?subject=Endorsement Process).


## Candidate Questionnaire for 2016

#####1. How can the local jurisdictions work with ODOT to improve safety and accessibility for all road users and establish a clear process for facilitating the eventual handover of state controlled dangerous urban arterials to local jurisdictions?
#####2. If elected what are your plans to implement Vision Zero?
#####3. Protected bikes lanes are more effective in protecting vulnerable users than painted bike lanes. Similarly, there have been multiple community calls for diversion on greenways. If elected how will you address the call for increased physical protection and the addition to diverters on adjacent greenways?
#####4. Transportation costs are often more than 20% of a householdâ€™s budget, and many households are too poor to drive to meet all of their daily needs. Biking, walking, and transit are the most affordable transport solutions. Street fees, congestion pricing, reduced price transit passes, and demand-responsive parking rates are some of the proposed tools to manage auto congestion and raise needed funds locally for maintenance and safety improvements. What are your plans to reduce transportation costs for low income families? 
#####5. Arterials need sidewalks for safe access to transit. Portland has significant gaps in this network which need tailored solutions in differing areas of Portland. Many of these gaps occur in neighborhoods that rely heavily on transit and require a significant amount of walking to reach nearby stops. What are your plans for sidewalk gaps, especially with regard to transit accessibility and equity in the outer neighborhoods?
#####6. Do you have any specific accomplishments improving biking, walking and transit in Oregon or other places?
#####7. What makes you a viable candidate?
#####8. We know that in order to make it easy for people in our region to meet their daily transportation needs by walking and riding bikes, they require frequent and reliable transit service. What ideas are you willing to support to increase funding for transit operations?
