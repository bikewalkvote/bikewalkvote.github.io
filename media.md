    <blockquote>
    For a project that has been fought by activists since about 2006, the event showed that those who oppose it haven't given up and they're more organized and fired up than ever before.

    <blockquote>
    <p>With the votes counted from the May 15th primary, candidates supported by Bike Walk Vote did extremely well. In fact, five of the seven candidates they endorsed won outright and the remaining two — <a href="/candidates/mayor/jefferson-smith.html" title="Jefferson Smith's responses to the questionaire">Jefferson Smith</a> for mayor and <a href="/candidates/portland-city-council-position-1/mary-nolan.html" title="Mary Nolon's responses to the questionaire">Mary Nolan</a> for City Council — finished very close seconds and will sail into runoffs in November.</p>

    <blockquote>Portland is one of the most pedestrian/bike and public transit friendly cities in the country, a fact supported over the last few years by the city consistently ranking high in various top-10 lists (such as Biking Magazine and reports from the Department of Transportation). This makes transportation one of the most important issues in the race to replace outgoing Mayor Sam Adams.</blockquote>

This event – sponsored by nine groups supportive of cycling, walking and transit – packed the main auditorium in Portland State University’s 475-seat Lincoln Hall and was a good example of how interest groups can use these kinds of forums to prod candidates in their direction.</blockquote>
