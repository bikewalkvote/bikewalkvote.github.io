WHAT TO WRITE? 

-Financial falsehoods and misinformation. 
ODOT numbers for seismic retrofits are around 6 times off the numbers estimated by the CRC project itself. We really have no idea what the actual cost will be.


-Without WA, OR funding the bridge alone is too big of a financial risk for tax payers, especially when most commuters utilizing the bridge are coming from WA.

-Support OR businesses - our transportation dollars are needed elsewhere. 
With crumbling infrastructure around the state, the movement of freight and disbursement of goods throughout Oregon is threatened by depleting out coffers on the !-5.


We can stop this highway expansion, and we're finally close! 
Once this is finally stopped, we can move our state's transportation narrative forward - towards a more livable and equitable system for all.
