Election season 2014 has begin, and the most pressing threat to a livable Oregon (beyond the CRC)? An anti-transit ballot measure in Tigard that seriously threatens commuting options for Tigard and connections throughout the region. 

It's being voted on in March, with ballots out February 21st.

WE NEED YOUR HELP TO GET THE WORD OUT! The opposition is relying on lack of turn-out. We're phone banking Thursday evening, 2/20. If you want to help out (out of your belief in livable streets for all, OR your love of free pizza!) shoot us an e-mail at BikeWalkVote@gmail.com and we'll get you the details.

You can read more about the measure at [stopcongestion.org](http://stopcongestion.org/ "Stop Congestion Campaign Page") and in [this overview (PDF)](http://nebula.wsimg.com/c7e5a00fb92fd4ef2c9ebf3542c1be81?AccessKeyId=5C462A2E40A747A2CB52&disposition=0&alloworigin=1), which is summarized below.

## The basics

### 1) Less influence for Tigard 

Road diets, walkability upgrades, and transit become a defacto "no", regardless of what residents believe.

Permanently alters the Tigard charter to make the city actively opposed to transit, preventing their elected officials from even pursuing information on the benefits or detriments of new commuting options. Any CONSIDERATION of alterations to streets, including already planned road reconfigurations to improve pedestrian walkability and bikeability, and the implementation of already-extensively-planned transit options, cannot be considered until the city pays thousands of dollars to bring the considerations to a vote. Ties the hands of elected officials, and costs tax-payers thousands (around $55,000 for each issue) to bring even exploratory studies to a vote.

### 2) Hurts the local economy

By preventing the city from addressing congestion, movement of freight and commerce in the area will be stymied. This measure also has the potential to cause removal 300 local businesses. 
 
This measure will mean crowded roads and fewer options for commuting. Additionally, the EXISTING SW Corridor Plan DOES NOT place any transit on 99W - a concern for many Tigard residents - instead routing options to lower-capacity locations with minimal-to-no impact on existing road users. If this measure passes, it may force the state of Oregon (ODOT specifically), to use a road they have jurisdiction over, namely 99W, since it would become their ONLY option for following through on their commitment to a connected region. No one wants to put rail lines on 99W, which would require the removal of up to 300 area businesses. This ballot measure is trying to force an unwanted, unpopular, and unnecessary configuration in order to remove the potential for options for Tigard residents.

### 3) More congestion in Tigard 

Fewer options, more cars, more traffic jams. That means more time spent commuting for the average Tigard resident, and less time for family and other life activities.

By stripping residents of their right to choose how they get around, this measure forces more people to drive everywhere they need to go, creating more cars on the road and more congestion.
