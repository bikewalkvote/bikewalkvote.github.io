The Portland Street Fee discussion continues, and Bike Walk Vote has officially joined the collective voice calling for an equitable, safety-driven plan.

Bike Walk Vote, The BTA, Coalition for a Livable Future, Oregon Walks, and many others all agree - progressive fee distribution and greater spending on safety is the best way to raise funds our community streets desperately need.
