> "Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody."< -Jane Jacobs 

Bike Walk Vote has completed our endorsements for the primaries of 2014! After reviewing questionnaires submitted by the candidates, a public forum, and follow-up interviews for clarification, the candidates below represent what we feel are our best possible advocates in the political realm.
You can read their answers to our endorsement questionnaire in the <a href="/candidates.html">CANDIDATES</a> section of this website!

In order to create the safe, equitable, and efficient transportation system Oregon deserves, we need people in office who support our cause. Without their votes, even the best legislation doesn't stand a chance. Let's create a government where our voices and interests are represented. VOTE! And stay up to date with what's happening in your neighborhood, city, and state by signing up for our e-mail list!
