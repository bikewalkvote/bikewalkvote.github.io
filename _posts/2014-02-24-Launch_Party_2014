It's election season once again, and Bike Walk Vote is launching our involvement by empowering YOU, our supporters, to get your questions answered by candidates seeking your vote.



## March 15th, 6-9pm
> Join Bike Walk Vote and a panel of political candidates to get your questions answered, give endorsement input, and learn bout upcoming election initiatives!


Drinks, delicousness, and direct democracy!


We've already sent out endorsement questionnaires, built by YOU, to political candidates seeking our endorsement this spring and fall - now's the chance to question them yourselves. 


Get informed, get empowered, grab a drink or two, and learn about where Bike Walk Vote is headed this year and beyond.


It's time to build the transportation system Portland & Oregon deserve. Come join Bike Walk Vote and your potential representatives to make it happen!
