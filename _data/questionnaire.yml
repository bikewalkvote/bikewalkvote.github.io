questions:
  safety:
    How can the local jurisdictions work with ODOT to improve safety and
    accessibility for all road users and establish a clear process for
    facilitating the eventual handover of state controlled dangerous urban
    arterials to local jurisdictions?
  visionZero:
    If elected what are your plans to implement Vision Zero?
  barriers:
    Protected bikes lanes are more effective in protecting vulnerable users than
    painted bike lanes. Similarly, there have been multiple community calls for
    diversion on greenways. If elected how will you address the call for
    increased physical protection and the addition to diverters on adjacent
    greenways?
  transportationCosts:
    Transportation costs are often more than 20% of a householdâ€™s budget, and
    many households are too poor to drive to meet all of their daily needs.
    Biking, walking, and transit are the most affordable transport solutions.
    Street fees, congestion pricing, reduced price transit passes, and
    demand-responsive parking rates are some of the proposed tools to manage auto
    congestion and raise needed funds locally for maintenance and safety
    improvements. What are your plans to reduce transportation costs for low
    income families? 
  sidewalks:
    Arterials need sidewalks for safe access to transit. Portland has significant
    gaps in this network which need tailored solutions in differing areas of
    Portland. Many of these gaps occur in neighborhoods that rely heavily on
    transit and require a significant amount of walking to reach nearby stops.
    What are your plans for sidewalk gaps, especially with regard to transit
    accessibility and equity in the outer neighborhoods?
  accomplishments:
    Do you have any specific accomplishments improving biking, walking and
    transit in Oregon or other places?
  viability:
    What makes you a viable candidate?
  transitFunding:
    We know that in order to make it easy for people in our region to meet their
    daily transportation needs by walking and riding bikes, they require frequent
    and reliable transit service. What ideas are you willing to support to
    increase funding for transit operations?
