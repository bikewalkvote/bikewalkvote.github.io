Reason: While serving in the Oregon House of Representatives, Jessica Vega Pederson has consistently fought for safer more accessible transportation infrastructure including her service on the Outer Powell Transportation Safety Project Decision Committee, the Powell Division Steering Committee, and the Division-Midway Neighborhood Street Plan Work Group. She has worked to increase state and local investments for improved sidewalks and greenways. She also fought for and won over $20 million for road safety projects in east Portland including sidewalks, crosswalks, and curb extensions. Bike Walk Vote x`endorsed her during her 2012 run for the Oregon House District 47 seat and we are proud to do so again in her run for Multnomah County Commissioner District 3.
