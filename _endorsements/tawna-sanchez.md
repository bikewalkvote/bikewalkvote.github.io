questionnaire_answers:
  safety: The management and safety upgrades to state-owned roads in Portland should
    be labeled as a disaster. We need to put public pressure on the state to get their
    act together, particularly on high crash corridors like Powell and Barbur Boulevards.
    The delays in getting safety improvements on these streets is resulting directly
    in the deaths of bicyclists and pedestrians.  We need to work with the City to
    shift ownership of these assets to the City and integrate them into the Vision
    Zero program. I have experience working on these issues through my work at the
    Native American Youth and Family (NAYA) Center. For years, we lacked adequate
    sidewalks so that our clients could safely walk from the bus stop or from their
    house in the neighborhood to the Center. We pushed hard to expand bus service
    and add sidewalks and eventually we succeeded.
  visionZero: I want to be a champion in the Legislature for securing state funding
    for needed transportation improvement around Portland – particularly in the underserved
    parts of this community. The vision laid out by the City is a good one, but we
    need the resources to implement it and meet the extensive backlog of delayed maintenance.
    In addition, I want to be a champion for the part of my district like Cully and
    Concordia that still have real unmet safety needs – sidewalks must be installed,
    problematic intersections addressed, and better options for cyclists to use the
    streets safely.
  barriers: Protected bike lanes, expanded diverters, and a larger network of greenways
    are all important ways to support active transit and keep cyclists safe from vehicles.
    I would push for their inclusion in our transportation planning and improvements.
  transportationCosts: I hear from the families that we are working with about the
    impact high transportation costs have on their household budgets. This problem
    has gotten worse in recent years as lower-income families are forced to look for
    affordable housing farther and farther from the city center. I am very concerned
    about the impact of potential revenues sources on lower-income residents. The
    proposed gas tax, for instance, is regressive and will hit poor residents the
    hardest. I would want us to look at ideas like a progressive income tax or putting
    a price on carbon through programs like cap & invest that can fund needed improvements
    as well as cushion the transition for low-income and vulnerable populations. We
    also must make improvements and add service to our transit system to meet the
    needs of those who do not own a vehicle.
  sidewalks: 'We need to look at how our transit system is being used and where there
    the needs of users are not being met. I worked directly on this when it came to
    expanding service on Columbia Boulevard and it took years to get leaders to recognize
    the problem and do something. We should be targeting the parts of this community
    that have the most need. People in these neighborhoods are some of the most dependent
    on transit and yet they must use some of the least safe stops to access the system. '
  accomplishments: We won an important victory, creating that transit access to the
    neighborhood we serve, but our work continues. Right now that bus service only
    runs in the mornings and late afternoons, restricting the ability of local residents
    and our clients from accessing transit. We continue to advocate for expanded service
    during the day.
  viability: I have lived and worked in the District for two decades. I know the community
    and its residents. The list of community leaders supporting me is a long one,
    including Mayors Sam Adams and Tom Potter, County Chair Beverly Stein, former
    County Commissioners Maria Rojo De Steffey and Barbara Willer, State Senator Chip
    Shields, Representative Joe Gallegos and advocates like Shawn Fleek, Lee Po Cha,
    Al Jubitz, Shelli Romero, Gale Castillo, Promise King, and Nichole Maher. I have
    raised more than my opponent and I am knocking doors three nights a week. I will
    do what it takes to win this race.
  transitFunding: Transit is essential for helping our low-income families get around
    the city. We should focus on providing an effective transportation network so
    that people do not need their own vehicle to meet their transportation needs.
    Expanding bus service, particularly to the underserved part of our community,
    is a central piece of this work. I would want to push at the state, regional,
    and federal level for additional funding for transit. We should not be raising
    the price of ridership as this makes it harder for those who most need this service
    to access it. Instead, we must recognize the need for a shared community investment
    in our transit future.

Tawna Sanchez has a clear commitment to safety including a desire to end the disastrous nature of ODOT’s management of their orphan highways. She will fight for inclusion of dedicated biking and walking transportation funding if sent to Salem. Her commitment to new, progressive funding sources and her dedication to use the new funding for vulnerable road users and populations lacking access to adequate transportation options is the leadership we need in Salem. She has a proven track record, community support, and a global understanding of active transportation issues. Bike Walk Vote is proud to be stand alongside her long list of pro bike/walk/transit endorsements.

We look forward to the upcoming elections and hope to see the candidates that we have endorsed moving active transportation forward in the region.
