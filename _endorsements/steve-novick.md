  safety: Generally, we need ODOT to come to the table. The City can't take over the
    facilities unless they are improved to our standards. The City needs to work more
    with advocates to put pressure on Salem. Rep. Shemia Fagan and her colleagues
    obtained $17 million for improvements to a section of outer Powell, and I serve
    on the committee overseeing those improvements; there are significant issues that
    need to be resolved, but this could be an important first step toward transfer
    of Powell, perhaps a section at a time, to the city. I look forward to continuing
    to work with the Portland delegation to get more of the necessary funds to make
    these major roads more safe and accessible for all road users, and prepare them
    for eventual city control and maintenance.
  visionZero: We plan to install unmanned speed cameras along high-crash corridors;
    getting the Legislature to allow such an effort was a major City priority in the
    2015 session. We will continue to look for streets where we should reduce speed
    limits (which as you know often requires State permission.) In this year’s budget,
    I fought for, and we allocated, $300,000 for Safe Routes to School programming
    in middle and high schools. I will continue to seek funds - Federal, State, or
    local - to improve bike and ped infrastructure. Under Director Treat’s leadership,
    PBOT is focused on Vision Zero throughout the bureau. I will continue my support
    for this important initiative, and to work with PBOT to move us toward the goal
    of zero road fatalities.
  barriers: |-
    I have supported Director Treat in the fight to make our neighborhood greenway system safer and better for our citizens. I brought to council the first comprehensive look at greenways and how they are functioning. This comprehensive report has led, and will continue to lead to greater investment and construction of more diverters.

    For example, after hearing from community members I worked with PBOT to install additional diverters on Clinton which have led to a safer and more comfortable experience for all users in the road.

    In addition, it is now city policy to encourage protected bikeways in new development, and I have been a vocal proponent of this in our comprehensive plan discussions.
  transportationCosts: "I plan on continuing the work of PBOT to make biking and walking
    more accessible. Since becoming Commissioner in charge of Transportation I made
    it a priority to get the needed revenues to fix our streets, with a clear focus
    on improving safety. This ultimately led to the unanimous vote of Council to move
    a gas tax to a public vote this May. Nearly half of the money raised by the gas
    tax will go to sidewalks, safer crossings and greenways to help people access
    biking and walking facilities. Elements of the business community argued that
    between 75% and 100% of any revenue should go solely to street repair, but I insisted
    that we also needed to focus on bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure. The largest
    share of the safety investments will be in East Portland.\nOver the past few years,
    the City has participated with Trimet and PPS to give all school students free
    transit passes. This is important, but I would of course like to see us find funding
    to do this for youth in all areas of the city, not just those attending PPS. \n\nI
    have spent a good deal of my time working with local and regional colleagues in
    planning the proposed new high capacity transit lines along the Southwest Corridor
    and inner Powell / outer Division. One concern raised by residents along the Powell-Division
    corridor has been that improved transit might lead to gentrification and displacement.
    We are exploring the option of a long, skinny urban renewal area along the proposed
    line to raise funds to land-bank affordable housing."
  sidewalks: In my first three years in office, one thing I am most proud of is my
    ongoing effort to improve quality of and access to transit along 122d. When I
    was running in 2011-12, I often heard from people in east Portland that they needed
    more frequent service on 122d. When I brought this up with TriMet, they said that
    they could only justify upgrading service if the city invested in filling sidewalk
    gaps and fixing dangerous intersections along the route. When we had a budget
    surplus last year, I told the Mayor that making a down payment on those investments
    was my highest priority, and obtained $4 million for that work. The gas tax we
    hope to pass will provide millions more to address sidewalk gaps along 122d and
    elsewhere. Trimet has pledged that they will in fact bring more frequent service
    to 122nd, giving many more people access to needed public transportation.
  accomplishments: "After nearly 30 years in which the City Council never had the
    political courage to seek a local funding source for either street repair or bicycle
    / pedestrian infrastructure, I took that cause on - at considerable political
    cost -  and my and the Mayor’s efforts ultimately led to a unanimous council vote
    for the gas tax, which will go to the voters this May, which will include significant
    funding for bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure. I have already described my
    work to improve transit on 122d. \n\nI worked with PBOT staff to establish the
    City’s partnership with Nike to bring Biketown, the most affordable and technologically
    advanced bike share program, to Portland starting this next July. And I’ve worked
    to expand our greenway program, getting the City to invest in diverters and further
    safety measures to ensure the greenway program continues to be successful. \nLater
    this year, PBOT will implement the Foster Road Transportation and Streetscape
    \ project, to improve safety for pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers on Foster
    between 50th and 90th."
  viability: I was elected with nearly 75% of the vote in 2012. Having been active
    in Oregon politics and progressive activism for over 20 years I have a wide range
    of supporters. My campaign has been endorsed by UFCW Local 555, AFSCME Local 189,
    SEIU Locals 49 & 503, IAFF Local 43, and NW Oregon Labor Council, as well as over
    100 prominent Portlanders. You can see the full list of endorsements at www.novickforportland.org/endorsements
  transitFunding: 'I’m looking forward to a state transportation package in 2017 and
    I will be advocating for transit investments that complement local investments
    in walking and biking infrastructure. My preference is always for more progressive
    taxes, but I believe improved transit is so critical that I am willing to support
    options, such as increasing the payroll tax that funds TriMet operations, that
    are not purely progressive. I would strongly support an effort to amend the state
    constitution to allow gas tax revenues to be used for transit. If and when a VMT
    becomes a more politically viable option, that is another possibility. '

Commissioner Steve Novick’s record demonstrates his commitment to active transportation. He has a history of pushing for innovative local transportation funding alternatives. One thing that set Novick apart from the other candidates that we interviewed was his clear understanding of parking policy and induced transportation demand. Additionally, any of the three major mayoral candidates would support a more progressive bike/walk agenda, we believe Novick will take full advantage of this new political landscape.
