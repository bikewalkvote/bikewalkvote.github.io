Bike Walk Vote is proud to endorse Sarah Iannarone for Mayor of Portland. Bike Walk Vote is also proud to give Green Lights to Ted Wheeler and Jules Bailey, affirming that they have strong records on active transportation and have the skills to represent the transportation needs of the city.

Sarah Iannarone has a depth of knowledge about the intersection between the built environment and public policy and how they influence transportation system design, safety outcomes, equity, and personal transportation choices. Additionally, she has the bold vision to move the city from itâ€™s current state of resting on laurels to re-emerging as a model city for active transportation. As the only citywide candidate who lives, works and rides in east Portland her perspective is needed at city hall.
