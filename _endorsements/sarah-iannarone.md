questionnaire_answers:
  safety: "The Oregon Dept of Transportation has a significant amount of streets in rural and suburban environments. It is there that it should focus its resources. There is no doubt that State controlled arterials in urban environments are best managed by city engineers most familiar with the network and who hear directly from constituents. There is also no doubt that urban arterials are some of the most dangerous streets for people biking and walking.
    I believe the State has been unable to come to terms with why turning over urban arterials to local governments would be to their own benefit. If elected, I would advocate in Salem for a funding source that allows ODOT to turn over urban arterials to local jurisdictions so that the agency is incentivized to move forward quicker on jurisdictional transfers. This also has the benefit of providing municipalities the resources to adequately maintain those arterials in the short term.
    Where funding is unavailable, I would move quickly to pressure ODOT to incrementally turn over parts of urban arterials so that the City of Portland can achieve its safety goals with signal timing and low-cost striping improvements immediately."
  visionZero: "First, I would listen. Many stakeholders have put in significant time and energy giving their ideas to City staff and going through a process to identify citywide priorities. I would give deference to that process and work quickly to implement the priorities identified by the vision zero task force."
  barriers: "We need to move quickly to create a more people-friendly city. We also know what we need to do to build out the network that has been in the City’s plans for years. It involves more robust neighborhood greenways, better facilities where people currently ride, and basic infrastructure where currently none exists. Protected bike lanes have been rightfully lauded for their ability to get more people on bikes (i.e. the “interested but concerned”). If we are serious about meeting our mode share goals, we must build more. And there’s no shortage of low-hanging fruit. Madison from SE 11th to the Hawthorne Bridge carries hundreds of bikes per day with paint as the only separation, we could build a protected bicycle and transit lane overnight if we were serious about encouraging more people to bike. We need to do more and if I’m Mayor, I will commit to building 1, 3, 5, and 7 miles of protected bike lanes during my first four years in office, respectively. And unlike other Mayors (Ahem…Chicago), I will not water down the definition of protected bike lane to meet this goal. The reason we have not been as aggressive in our biking and walking goals is because we haven’t prioritized these needs enough. That is why I will set a goal to implement 4 new diverters per year during my first 4 years in office. Diverters not only solve a network connectivity goal but they also improve neighborhood livability. Regional and cut-through traffic do not belong in our neighborhoods. Diverters not only improve multimodal mobility, they also improve quality of life and neighborhood vitality; and it is these elements which have made Portland what it is today."
  transportationCosts: "We need to properly incentivize and protect the transportation users that have the least impact environmentally and financially on our transportation system. People with lower incomes are also the most likely to be impacted with not only cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, but also traffic violence. Moreover, people with lower incomes are more likely to live in areas that are park deficient. We need to turn all of these statistics on their head. By providing people with a safer places to walk and bike we can address a whole host of societal ills. Sidewalks and neighborhood greenways are more like parks than they are streets. This is because they foster human interaction, public health, and have a sense of place. Our neighborhood greenways ought to function like linear parks with minimal traffic and opportunities to unite people. We need a mayor with a bold vision for Portland. Instead of focusing on just a green loop downtown, we need to think of how we will unite our entire city with a green loop. One potential option is a loop bounded by SE Clinton, NE Going, N. Vancouver, and SE 130th. We must set ambitious, yet achievable, goals if we are serious about improving health outcomes and reducing transportation costs for people with lower incomes. Portlanders are hungry for more transportation options; as mayor, I will work hard to deliver mobility options that meet the needs of everyone. We also need to address the structural issues associated with displacement in our community. We cannot reduce transportation costs without looking at housing costs. We need to have a comprehensive strategy that matches affordable housing and transportation. How will I do this? One option is to offer system development charge (SDC) waivers to developers who make a significant number of their units
    affordable. There are many more options and I look forward to listening to people who are working in advocacy and justice organizations to hear some of their ideas for things the City can implement quickly to repair structural inequity."
  sidewalks: "Sidewalk gaps present a major challenge for allowing people to access transit. In an era with shrinking budgets, we need to re-examine how we allocate our city’s greatest asset: street space. Free parking for cars should be not be prioritized over safe walking infrastructure in areas where sidewalks are lacking. NE 148th is a great example of a street that has 5 lanes for cars (including free parking) and no sidewalks. Instead of free parking, that space could be separated by a jersey barrier to provide a safe space for people walking and biking. Saying there is “no space” or “no money” is no excuse when there are low-cost safety interventions we can make immediately to provide better protection. Further, following the lead of Los Angeles, we must continue to retrofit stretches of our car-centric arterials to human-centric boulevards. I would propose the stretch of SE 82nd Avenue between Division and Holgate. It is this kind of creative thinking that will be necessary for us to move swiftly to save lives and improve health and financial outcomes for all Portlanders."
  accomplishments: "I am a long-time pedestrian and bicycle safety advocate. Back in 2012, my neighbors and I worked with then mayor Sam Adams to install safety improvements. I’ve long worked with my neighbors on the Foster Streetscape plan, which was approved by City Council in 2014. In 2005, I started the Arleta Triangle Project to improve pedestrian safety in high speed Woodstock Blvd corridor at SE 72nd Avenue. As a member of the Mixed Use Zones Project of the Comprehensive Plan Update, I’ve worked to align city zoning with PBOT’s Transportation Demand Management Plan for corridors and town centers. Finally, I walk the talk (or bike the talk). I have been a car-free Portlander for over a decade and am a
    life-long transportation cyclist. I commute over 7 miles each direction by bike or transit from my home in Outer Southeast Portland to my job at Portland State University downtown, and did so with my daughter—first by Burley Trailer and later by Xtracycle. I understand firsthand the personal commitment these major, necessary cultural and policy change will require of Portlanders and can support them in this transition."
  viability: "I have the bold vision, global expertise, practical knowledge, and collaborative mindset to lead Portland at this critical time. I am raising approximately $5000/week despite low name recognition, no prior elective experience, and little attention from mainstream media outlets. In my first month, I hired a full paid staff and setup a campaign headquarters, built a quality website and established a robust social media presence. I am securing endorsements, but they are not yet published. By all accounts, I am performing well in debates. I have the policy acumen, personal stature, relevant networks, and sense of humor needed to sustain me in this race (and the job of mayor)."
  transitFunding: "Meeting the City’s transit mode share goals will require us to continue to work well with TriMet to improve service. As Mayor, I will support TriMet’s goals to increase funding for transit and I will advocate that transit investment be supplemented with investments in access in transit, as well as housing, so that people can bike and walk safely to the bus stop. But I will not stop there. I will make a commitment to allocate more street space to transit because it is unjust for a bus carrying 40 people to be stuck behind single occupancy vehicles. With a few cans of paint and some political will, we can create more transit only lanes (especially in the urban core and adjacent bridgeheads) and give signal priority to transit vehicles so that busses do not get stuck in congestion.
    I will also support local investment in transit by funding youth pass, a program that allows Portland Public School students to ride the bus for free. (As the parent of a teenager, this has served me well—both in eliminating “Mom Taxi” from my duties and adding to arguments why a driver’s license is NOT necessary, lol.) This is a smart city investment not only because it reduces the barrier to entry but because it allows young people to explore their city and develop the habit of taking transit."
