questionnaire_answers:
  safety: We will be looking for new resources for our region's transportation systems.  Our
    process needs to include ODOT and local jurisdictions working together to be clear
    about roles and responsibilities.  That should include ODOT's role for transferring
    orphan highways and adequate resource commitments for capital improvements for
    safe sidewalks and biking, as well as maintenance funding.
  visionZero: Aggressively advocate for funding to Safe Routes to School and flexible
    funding for our Active Transportation Plan.  At our current rate it will take
    100 years to build out our Active Transportation Plan.  I will continue my advocacy
    that we identify funds to build out the plan in 30 years.
  barriers: "building a\\out protected lanes is critical for safety, and will create
    the feeling of safety.  That is what will get our region over the tipping point
    and create substantial new users.  By traveling to and carefully studying the
    Netherlands bike network, I was able to gain an appreciation for how critical
    safe passage is to increasing biking and walking numbers.  I have already been
    successful in securing funding for a major part of the NP Greenway. What was once
    a landfill in St John's has been restored back to a natural area. I was lucky
    to visit the 300 area area next to Smith and Bybee lakes. Among the wildlife was
    a four point Buck--right in Portland's city limits.  Yet this area has been closed
    to the public and is also a key link in the NP Greenway.  Now because of the funding
    secured, the area will be open to North Portland and the rest of the city.   It
    will be the envy of Forest Park!  \n\nWe have much more to do and focusing on
    the NP Greenway will be a key priority.  However, building out protected lanes
    all over the region will be critical.  I recently faced a significant challenge
    fighting for and voting for the Westside Trail.  In doing so, I heard many angry
    voices about the troubles and homeless people the trails would bring to peoples
    backyards.  Indeed, these fears do not come to life when trails are built, yet
    our work to educate the community will need to continue."

    My highest priority will be to advocate for reduced fares.  More than 30
    % of Tri-Met riders make less than $20,000 per year.  Paying $5 per day to get back and forth from work or for other needs is simply too expensive for many trying to pay rent, and for food and medicine.  Jurisdictions like Seattle, San Francisco, and Salt Lake have reduced fares in place.  I have worked to advocate for change to our system with Tri-Met and others.  I have been able to secure agreement for goals to address fare equity, but there is a tremendous amount left to do.  And it will take a large effort that includes the community and grassroots organizing.  I am very pleased to see this question and hope we can strategize together in the future.
  sidewalks: Prioritizing equity is critical.  I have been successful in making substantial
    changes to our TOD program to prioritize affordable housing in corridors, which
    will make sure that the areas where we are investing in infrastructure includes
    \low income communities.
  accomplishments: Yes. As outlined above including Transit Oriented Development
    policy change,  NP Greenway development, Westside Trail Alignment and approval,
    Active Transportation Plan approval, Safe Routes to School support.
  viability: I am currently unopposed in running for reelection and have begun to
    raise resources for my campaign.
  transitFunding: A regional bond or other funding measure.
