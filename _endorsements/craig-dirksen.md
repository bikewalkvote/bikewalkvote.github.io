questionnaire_answers:
    safety: A process for jurisdictional transfer, along with money to upgrade to standard,
      must be part of the State transportation package anticipated for the 2017 legislative
      session.
    visionZero: As we update the Regional Transportation Plan (in process, due in 2018),
      safety must be a primary priority.
    barriers: I have long been a proponent of off-street bike routes where feasible.
      Please note my work on the Fanno Creek Trail. Additionally, street designs that
      better separate bike and ped from vehicle traffic exist, and should be the standard
      in our region.
    transportationCosts: As we find additional money for transportation improvements,
      our goal should be to create a complete transportation system with all modes in
      the proper ratio to each other to complement each other. Our goal should always
      be to provide people with greater transportation choices.
    sidewalks: Portland isn't alone. All over the region there are older neighborhoods
      that lack sufficient bike & ped facilities. I am advocating to increase funding
      for active transportation in the upcoming funding cycle to preserve the buying
      power of the last cycle as a base line, and looking for what additional money
      may be available through the federal FAST act and the upcoming State package.
    accomplishments: I would reference my work improving the trail system in Tigard
      during my tenure as Mayor. Since being on Metro Council, I was one of the primary
      authors of the Metro Climate Smart Strategy, which identifies increased reliance
      and prioritization of bike, ped, and transit in order to reduce green house gas
      emissions in our region. That strategy will be borne out by the update to the
      RTP.
    viability: I have the background and experience to know what the challenges are,
      and the solutions to those challenges. I have the respect and confidence of those
      we work with at the local, regional, and state levels to form the coalitions needed
      to create those solutions.
    transitFunding: I support TriMet's plan to increase the payroll tax they have proposed.
      The regional government is a major avenue to sourcing Federal grants and programs
      to fund upgrades and improvements. I am also working with TriMet and local jurisdictions
      to find more efficient ways to provide local bus service in non-centralized areas
      where many lower-income and transit dependent communities exist.

Dirksen has a long record of work on trails and transit efforts in Washington County. As mayor of Tigard he worked to improve and expand the Fanno Creek trail. He was also an outspoken critic of Tigardâ€™s anti-transit measure in 2014. Since serving on the Metro council he has worked on the Metro Climate Smart Strategy, which identifies increased reliance and prioritization of bike, ped, and transit in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our region. Bike Walk Vote endorsed Dirksen in his first run for the Metro council and we are proud to do so again.
