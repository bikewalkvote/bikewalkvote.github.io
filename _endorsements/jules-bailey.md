questionnaire_answers:
  safety: When you look at some of the worst streets in Portland for pedestrians and
    people on bicycles, streets like Powell, Lombard, 82nd Ave, and others, many if
    not most of them are state roads. Through my work with the Joint Policy Advisory
    Council on Transportation as a County Commissioner, I have already begun working
    on “orphan highways” to address safety and prepare them for transfer. Moreover,
    in the legislature, I helped pass funding for sidewalks on these routes, especially
    on Powell and 122nd Ave.  We need a Mayor that has the credibility in Salem to
    work with ODOT and the legislature, and also the relationships and experience
    of working regionally with JPACT, so that we can fund more investments in safety
    and move orphan highways back into Portland jurisdiction.
  visionZero: Even one fatality on the streets is too many, but it exposes an even
    deeper problem in how we prioritize our resources when the fatality is that of
    a vulnerable user.  In the legislature, I championed expansion to the laws that
    define a vulnerable user, and sponsored the legislation that created neighborhood
    greenways. As Mayor, I will make Vision Zero a priority in planning, transportation,
    and law enforcement.  The city has enormous resources already in its staff - people
    like Greg Raisman and others with a deep understanding of these issues - and Portland
    is blessed with informed and active constituencies like OPAL, BTA, Oregon Walks,
    BWV and others who can help shape implementation. I support Safe Routes to School.
    Right now my son won’t be able to safely walk to the elementary school he will
    attend. I will work to make sure he and other kids have safe options. As Mayor,
    I will work with coalitions and empower staff to make Vision Zero a reality across
    our transportation system.
  barriers: Despite all the work we’ve done, we still have a transportation system
    originally designed for cars that bicycles have adapted into.  We need to change
    that. I frequently ride my bicycle to work from Multnomah Village.  The protected
    bike lanes on Multnomah Boulevard make all the difference in my safety.  While
    they cost more, they save lives, and even non-bicycle users prefer them.  (Drivers
    feel at ease if they are less likely to hit a vulnerable user.)  Any new transportation
    funding source should prioritize protected bike lanes. Similarly, neighborhood
    greenways only work when they are respected by all users.  Often, that means diversion
    and other traffic changes to ensure greenways are accessible and safe for people
    on bicycles. I’ve been a long time proponent of strong greenways (and helped to
    create them!), and will also use law enforcement to ensure greenways are respected
    by drivers.
  transportationCosts: I am the only candidate in the race to have called for congestion
    pricing, carbon pricing, and variable parking rates to address traffic management
    and raise funds.  While I have been criticized for this advocacy, I believe these
    are important tools. As we implement these tools, we need to put funding back
    into the policies and programs that support low income families, like transit
    passes, better bus service, and safety improvements, particularly in east Portland.
    However, some of those investments require reform in how we fund our transportation
    and transit system, like reforming the highway trust fund.  I am the only candidate
    with the experience and connections in the legislature to lead a joint city-state
    conversation as Mayor.
  sidewalks: As mentioned, I already have a history of working to bring more funding
    for sidewalks in east Portland.  As Mayor, I will continue to make it a priority.
    At our first candidate debate, each candidate was asked to bring a picture of
    the place in Portland most in need of investment and change.  I brought a picture
    of the intersection at 122nd and Powell (now changing), and used it as an example
    of the need for more pedestrian the transit access in Portland.  I’ve worked on
    sidewalk gaps in the legislature, prioritized these streets in my work on JPACT,
    and campaigned on these issues, so you know I will be a champion as Mayor.
  accomplishments: "I have made work on improving biking, walking, and transit a hallmark
    of my time in public service. Specifically, I:\n•\tCarried the bill to increase
    the payroll tax for Tri-met, earning me a public transit award,\n•\tSponsored
    legislation to increase the percent of the highway fund for in-right-of-way bicycle
    projects (the increase was ultimately folded into the 2009 JTA),\n•\tCreated and
    funded an out-of-right-of-way state fund for urban and rural bike and pedestrian
    trails,\n•\tFunded sidewalk improvements in east Portland,\n•\tSponsored the “Idaho
    Stop” bill, which, while it did not pass, helped pave the way for neighborhood
    greenways,\n•\tHelped pass the neighborhood greenways legislation,\n•\tExpanded
    the definition of vulnerable users to create safer roads, and\n•\tOn JPACT, helped
    create and pass the “Climate Smart Communities” plan.\n"
  viability: "People across Portland have stepped up to support my campaign.  I have
    over 500 individual contributors to my race.  I have limited my campaign contributions
    to $250 per person, which has brought grassroots support from across the city.
    \ I have over 100 committed house parties, and supporters are knocking on doors
    in every neighborhood for me.  I have major endorsements from individuals like
    Gov. Barbara Roberts and key legislators, as well as labor and other groups. I
    have run multiple races where I personally  have knocked on thousands of doors,
    walking neighborhoods in Portland. \n\nMoney is important, but it doesn’t win
    Mayoral races. This is a grassroots campaign, and I would be honored to continue
    to work with Bike Walk Vote in this race and as Mayor.\n"
  transitFunding: 'As State Representative, I carried the bill to increase the payroll
    tax capacity for Trimet that helped lead to the creation of the Orange Line.  But
    the payroll tax is a limited way to raise transit funds, and forces more fare
    increases onto riders.  I believe we need to reform our constitution so that taxes
    and fees intended to reduce congestion and pollution in the transportation system
    can be used to fund transit.  It won’t be easy, but everything else is a Band-aid.
    With reform, we need to use carbon taxes and congestion pricing to fund transit. '
