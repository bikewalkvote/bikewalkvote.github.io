questionnaire_answers:
  safety: Metro is responsible for regional and long range transportation planning.
    Each local jurisdiction has a lot of flexibility on how to work with ODOT. However,
    Metro can help create (with stakeholder input) clear criteria for guiding transitions
    from state to local control. These criteria will include factors such as local
    expertise, regional transportation needs, safety issues, etc. Metro also is the
    key agency for highlighting and prioritizing the key trouble spots regionally
    and directing federal and state funds to those areas in most need. Whether hand-over
    is the best option will depend on the transportation need, the cost, and the type
    (complexity) of the project.
  visionZero: Vision Zero is a plan that is critical in Portland but could also stand
    more emphasis in the outlying SW Metro areas. Bicycle commuting in District 3
    is much more limited than in the Portland core. I would emphasize bicycle routes
    that improve connectivity between residential and job areas, particularly in Tigard,
    Tualatin, and Sherwood. I would work to prioritize these on the regional level
    since these are major job centers in this region. I would particularly stress
    radial networks out from the (hopefully) soon to be developed SW corridor and
    along both Tualatin Sherwood Rd and 99W. We need more separated lanes and better
    marking throughout the district. Metro is not the agency that implements those
    changes but it can encourage them and set standards.
  barriers: 'You have to make bicycle commuting more of a priority in more areas.
    If we build it, "the will ride" is my philosophy, at least if residential areas
    are within about ½-3/4 hour of work places. Protection can range from complete
    separation to attached pylons. Thee are not many greenway paths in my area so
    I would rely on groups like B-W-V for ideas on the best ways to separate. Tualatin
    is dedicating a new Tualatin Greenway path in April. I want to add that I also
    want to create more rural bikeways since I live in an area that sees many riders
    in summer, and all the roads are dangerous for bicycles. '
  transportationCosts: 'Mass transit is a major need in the District #3 area (SW
    - including Wilsonville, Sherwood, Tualatin, Durham, King City, Tigard, and S
    Beaverton). If affordable , I would build a parallel line to WES so trains could
    run all day at frequent intervals with better equipment. I would also support
    expansions of SMART and Tualatin Shuttle. I would build a SW Max line as quickly
    as possible with a tunnel to PCC Sylvania.  I support student passes, and special
    pass rates for handicapped and people on marginal incomes. Safety improvements,
    particularly for students getting to schools walking and biking, should be a priority
    for the City and County budgets. Metro''s role is limited but can encourage standard
    criteria and make regional safety response data more widely disseminated.'
  sidewalks: This is particularly critical in the suburban cities with lower densities.
    I would look to smaller buses running on more frequent schedules with radial systems
    from the regional hubs or key "downtown" or job locations. The large buses are
    often underutilized, awkward, and costly. I would find a way (incentives?) to
    encourage Trimet to develop better links with local bus options. Solutions would
    have to be tailored to different areas and cities.  Densities in these areas are
    usually lower than in Portland
  accomplishments: I live in a rural area where cycling is quite unsafe. I have no
    specific accomplishments ( except that I organized a safety organization in Eugene/
    Springfield years ago on Pre's Trail [Oregon Trail Observers] to get lighting
    and better maintenance). I want to see a semi-rural network of bicycle lanes and/or
    paths that connect the regional parks, open-spaces, and summertime destinations
    (like  community farms). I think we have to envision a future where there is a
    network of bicycle pathways (safely designed) ringing the entire metropolitan
    area to a distance of approximately 30 miles from the end of transit service hubs.
    These would serve for recreation, but would also encourage people to see bike
    transport as an integral part of metropolitan life.  Of course I support a  CRC
    that has good bike, bus and pedestrian access and one the is a regional landmark
    the does justice to the significance of the Columbia River. I would strongly support
    rapid implementation of the Metro bicycle plan..but would suggest it be more extensive.
  viability: I am knowledgeable and have relevant experience on all the major activities
    carried out by Metro (land use, open space protection, solid waste, transportation),
    excluding the Zoo and pioneer cemeteries. But defining a viable candidacy for
    Metro is somewhat difficult since most people do not understand what Metro does.
    I have good startup money and am already known from previous candidacies in about
    1/3rd of the area. I am well known to most elected state figures and to most of
    the legislators in Salem. I have been active with OLCV, Onward Oregon, Washington
    County Democrats, OEC, and Tax Fairness Oregon. Getting people to read the qualifications
    is the hard part. I have considerable experience campaigning door-to-door and
    engage people in a very friendly manner.
  transitFunding: " I am somewhat upset that Metro did not push harder for extension
    of the SW corridor all the way to Sherwood…particularly to serve the industrial
    job zones in Tualatin and Sherwood. I am also dismayed they seem to have dropped
    active plans to do anything about congestion on 99W. I understand there is a NIMBY
    pushback in both Tualatin and Tigard and I would work hard to engage and convince
    voters that mass transit solutions are a key element for the future. As for funding,
    that is more difficult….I would look to a special regional transit tax in the
    tri-county area (but that would be a hard sell). I would help local jurisdictions
    develop the data and arguments to fund their specific mass transportation plans.
    Metro can work with their staffs (except in Tigard) to provide information, respond
    to concerns, set up local meetings,and help people envision longer term goals
    than patching potholes. I would first ask communities to identify their transportation
    goals and then help city staff respond with good data. I would look to extensive
    use of social media where appropriate."
