questionnaire_answers:
  safety: By maintaining political pressure and seeking additional legislative allies.  State
    resources for road transportation far exceed those of local governments.  Cities
    and counties can't afford to assume ownership, operation and maintenance of state-owned
    arterials without state funding to bring the assets to an urban standard of design
    and good repair.  Traditionally neither the legislature nor ODOT have given such
    transfers high priority.  A coalition of metro-area legislators, including Shemia
    Fagan and Jessica Vega Pederson, has led recent efforts to push transfer of Powell
    Blvd, 82nd Avenue and other urban arterials from ODOT to Portland and other local
    governments.  I will work with active transportation advocates to seek funding
    for such transfers, and complete-street retrofits as part of the transfers, as
    part of a 2017 state transportation funding measure.
  visionZero: I am working to establish Vision Zero as the safety performance standard
    for the update of the Regional Transportation Plan, scheduled for adoption in
    2018.  This RTP Update will implement the regional Transportation Safety Plan
    that Metro staff developed in 2012 but that local governments and ODOT resisted
    adopting at that time.  Since joining the Metro Council in 2013, I have pushed
    to make regional transportation plans more responsive to safety, active transportation,
    and transit needs.  In 2014 we successfully added active transportation policies
    to the RTP; 2016 to 2018 is our opportunity to build support for Vision Zero as
    the key standard for regional transportation policy.
  barriers: I started using SE Clinton as part of my bike commute over 40 years ago.  It
    became much safer after the City installed the diverter at SE 39th (now Cesar
    Chavez Blvd) 25 or 30 years ago, and again when the City this year added diverters
    at 32nd and 17th.  I strongly support development and improvement of the neighborhood
    greenways system, and protected bike lanes such as the NE Multnomah St. facility.  Metro
    can encourage local and ODOT construction of more protected bikeways and lanes
    by including stronger policy about safe bike facilities in the Regional Transportation
    Plan (now to 2018), and clearer project selection criteria in the allocation of
    federal flexible funds as part of the Metropolitan Transportation Improvement
    Program or “MTIP” (now to 2017).  Advocates will also need to press the local
    and state agencies that own, maintain and improve the street and road network
    to plan and build better bike projects.  Ultimately the MTIP is only as good as
    the city, county and ODOT project proposals that come to JPACT and Metro.
  transportationcosts: "Low income households face the greatest challenge in keeping
    their combined housing-and-transportation budget within a reasonable share of
    total household income.  Both parts of that combination should be addressed by
    public investment.  \n\nI’m working to expand the supply of regulated affordable
    (i.e., means-tested) housing, and to increase the share of new affordable housing
    in central locations with good transportation choices.  Too many of Portland’s
    most popular neighborhoods have seen displacement of lower-income households as
    rents rise and as rental property is converted to ownership.  Adding affordable
    units in those neighborhoods can slow and even reverse displacement.  \n\nMetro
    can help directly with our “transit oriented development” grants by investing
    in projects that provide permanent affordable housing units, and by helping local
    governments develop affordable housing programs through our “Equitable Housing”
    strategy.  In addition, I’m supporting legislative authorization for construction
    excise taxes to fund affordable housing, as well as an end to the Legislature’s
    prohibition on “inclusionary zoning,” in the current session.\n\nOn the transportation
    side, we need to increase transportation choices in areas like East Portland where
    lower-income households, many of them priced out of closer-in neighborhoods, are
    concentrated.  Pedestrian and bicycling facilities, and improved transit, are
    urgently needed in East Portland and other disadvantaged areas.  I co-chair the
    Powell-Division bus rapid transit project steering committee, and approach my
    work on that project from this perspective.  At the same time, we must anticipate
    the prospect that improved access to neighborhoods can lead to new development
    displacing current households, and pursue equitable housing strategies that retain
    the supply and maintain the price of currently affordable units.\n\nYour question
    also mentions various funding sources for street maintenance and safety improvements.
    \ I support all of them.  Note that parking fees and property-based street fees
    can be used for transit, but VMT fees and congestion pricing revenues are limited
    to street and road uses by the “highway trust fund” clause of the Oregon Constitution.
    \ Congestion pricing and per-mile fees are superior to gas taxes in the economic
    signals they send to drivers about how much and when they drive, but we all face
    a big challenge in getting “trust fund” dollars spent on safety and maintenance
    rather than chasing the unicorn of “congestion reduction” with expensive road
    widening to “eliminate bottlenecks.”\n"
  sidewalks: "I’m working to implement the Safe Routes to School coalition’s campaign
    to allocate $15 million in MTIP federal transportation funds managed by JPACT
    (with the advice and consent of the Metro Council) to pedestrian and bicycle safety
    investments and programs serving Title One schools in the metro area over the
    next three year investment cycle.  These are the schools with the highest percentages
    of kids from disadvantaged households, and include many of the school attendance
    areas with the least complete walking and biking networks.  This work will in
    nearly every case also benefit transit riders and other pedestrians in addition
    to schoolkids and parents.  \n\nIn addition, as co-chair of both the Powell-Division
    BRT and Southwest Corridor high capacity transit steering committees, I’m working
    to ensure that sidewalks, accessible transit stations, arterial crossings and
    bike facilities are included in both corridors as part of the transit project.
    \ In particular, improved sidewalks and crossings serving Division east of 82nd
    will have a major effect on pedestrian convenience and safety in presently poorly
    served and disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n"
  accomplishments: |
    As chief of staff to Portland Commissioner Earl Blumenauer and later as Portland planning director, I was part of the commissioner’s team of advisors from 1987 to 1993 as he initiated the push to expand the MAX system beyond the original Gresham line, started the city transportation department’s bicycle program, and conceived and started the Portland Streetcar system.  I was executive director for policy and planning at TriMet from 1997 to 2000 and was responsible for managing the “south-north” light rail proposal, elements of which have since been included in the Yellow Line, Green Line and Orange Line.  I helped site and secure funding for the Yellow Line as part of that work.

    Sometimes one can support biking, walking and transit by opposing wasteful, oversized road projects that would soak up state and local resources without adding transportation benefits.  I’ve done that at least twice in my career, by advising Governor Barbara Roberts on her decision to terminate the Western Bypass freeway project through rural Washington County while serving on her staff (1994) and by vigorously and publicly opposing the Columbia River Crossing project as executive director of 1000 Friends of Oregon (2008-2009) and candidate for Metro President and then for Metro Council (2010-2012).

    I’ve been a dues-paying member of BTA for 20 years, and have financially supported Oregon Walks (with a few lapses) since its inception as the Willamette Pedestrian Coalition.

    Finally, one can support biking and walking by doing them, and support transit by riding it.  In the 37 years I’ve both lived and worked in Portland, 90 percent of my work commute trips have been by transit or bike, and I’ve only suffered two injury accidents at the hands of negligent motorists in all that time.
  viability: 'I’ve twice run high-visibility and widely supported campaigns: in 2010
    for Metro President (which I narrowly lost) and in 2012 for my current position
    on the Council, which I won with more than 80 percent of the vote.  I am proud
    to have received Bike Walk Vote’s endorsement in 2012.  To date I’ve received
    early endorsements from the Oregon League of Conservation Voters, the Portland
    Association of Teachers PAC, and the AFSCME locals that represent most Metro employees.  As
    my past campaigns have shown, I’m fortunate to have many supporters who can help
    me earn the votes and resources necessary to win a contested race for this seat
    if I draw an opponent.  '

    Remembering the constitutional limitations on use of gas taxes and other road user fees, the best immediate opportunities lie in parking revenues (Portland applies some parking garage revenue to streetcar costs); growth in farebox revenue from increased ridership (particularly through low-cost increases in transit service frequency, reliability and coverage in high-demand areas); and state government payment of the cost of paratransit service for elderly and disabled riders who cannot use main-line transit service.  This latter reform would take a huge and growing federal mandate off the budget of TriMet and other transit agencies in Oregon and provide a significant boost to transit operating revenue for standard service.

    After these difficult-to-get sources, there’s the really big stuff, such as adoption of a carbon tax (although carbon taxes on vehicle fuels could only be spent on roads), sales tax or other non-road revenue the State currently doesn’t have; or persuading voters statewide to amend the constitution to allow new driving- or fuel-based fees to be allocated to transit.  Those are heavy lifts.  I support all of these approaches.

Metro Council member Bob Stacey has yet again received the enthusiastic endorsement of Bike Walk Vote. His multi-decade dedication to active transportation in all forms is a boon to the entire Metro area. Recently he has co-chaired the Powell-Division Transit and Development Project and the Southwest Corridor Plan and is an avid proponent for Safe Routes to Schools funding regionally. We need his dedication to continue to move these projects forward.

Stacey is working to implement Vision Zero language into the 2018 Regional Transportation Plan building on his successes in active transportation’s inclusion in the 2016 RTP. He has successfully worked with ODOT in the past and has the skills to continue to work with and put pressure on ODOT in future projects region-wide. His breadth of knowledge is invaluable, as such, Bike Walk Vote recommends that we send him back to Metro to continue to work for biking, walking and transit.
