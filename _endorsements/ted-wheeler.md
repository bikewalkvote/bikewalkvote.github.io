  safety: |
    I think the Mayor needs to reengage with both our regional and state partners to recognize we have a shared future in our infrastructure and that we need to stretch the dollars available as far as possible. That includes active participation in JPACT (as Multnomah County Chair I served for four years on this committee), but also pushing those other governments to commit to a shared vision for our transportation. It is that type of a process, that brings along ODOT and shows agreement is the best way to facilitate handover of the right urban arterials.

    As I led the early stages of development for the Sellwood Bridge project, I worked hard to ensure that bicycle and pedestrian safety would be a core part of the project. The results speak for themselves – there is now much greater access for cyclists and pedestrians. Achieving similar goals on future projects will require constant collaboration between the city, ODOT, and federal government.
  visionZero: "I strongly support and want to move forward with the vision put forward
    by Commissioner Steve Novick and PBOT. That includes both creating the funding
    for needed improvements and policy steps including:\n\n•\tEnsuring transportation
    infrastructure improvements are designed with our most vulnerable residents in
    mind, including things like sidewalk gaps and safer crossings;\n•\tIdentifying
    high-crash corridors where we can look to issues like speed, visibility, and safety
    for active transportation users; \n•\tAdding separated bike lanes and expanding
    greenways network;\n•\tEducating the public about multi-modal safety and working
    to build respect and appreciation for all methods of transportation; and \n•\tAttention
    to vulnerable populations including children, seniors, and people with disabilities
    in sidewalk design and installation. \n"
  barriers: |
    I am supportive of the idea of protected bike lanes and diversions on greenways and have been promoting them on the stump. We need to add these considerations to our planning and improvements to city streets.
  transportationCosts: "The best way we can reduce transportation cost is by making
    it easier for people to live closer to where they work and with access to good
    schools. Increasing housing costs are pushing low-income families farther out
    of the central city, adding to daily miles traveled and straining pocketbooks.
    As people move to chase affordability, they are often farther away from low-cost
    transit options. This is unacceptable. Creating more affordable housing is a way
    to cut transportation budget and support a more compact, active-transit friendly
    city. We must also do more to work with Tri-Met and Metro to identify how we can
    support affordable housing along our transit network. I do support the proposed
    temporary gas tax and, if elected, I will find a replacement for that revenue
    that is progressive and equitable towards low-income families.  \n\nAs Chair of
    Multnomah County I championed passage of a youth bill of rights which led to the
    first youth pass for PPS students. When I spoke at an OPAL Environmental Justice
    event last year focused on the Youth Pass program, I pledged to look for ways
    to improve the program. Too many low-income families are forced to absorb the
    cost of getting their kids to school. We can do better.  \n"
  sidewalks: |
    I am disturbed about the lack of progress when it comes to sidewalk safety, particularly in our outer neighborhoods. As you say, these are residents who are more likely to rely on public transit with varying levels of ability and health. They deserve sidewalks to safely access transit to work, shop, or enjoy the community. The proposed gas tax revenue and added state investments are a good start, we need to build on that with a sustainable, progressive revenue source that will let us reduce the maintenance backlog and expand sidewalk creation in needed neighborhoods.
  accomplishments: |
    I was County Chair when we completed the Sauvie Island Bridge, which increased the amount of sidewalks and bike lanes. I insisted that the Sellwood Bridge project include expanded bicycle and pedestrian options, and ensured that the bridge was built to accommodate future light rail. As Multnomah County Chair, I oversaw the redevelopment of 142nd Avenue underpass which was widened to accommodate bicycles and pedestrian. This dangerous throughway previously forced cyclists and pedestrians onto the roadway to navigate the underpass.
  viability: |
    I launched my campaign because I thought we needed better leadership in the Mayor’s office. Even after Mayor Hales dropped out, I kept working. I’ve had hundreds of meetings with people from across this community and I have immersed myself in the concerns of the citizens. I’ve raised a significant war chest and secured endorsements from a wide diversity of residents you can see at tedwheeler.com. My endorsers include the three most recent former mayors. I am working as hard to get elected mayor as I plan to work once I’m elected, out there every day talking with the people and trying to identify how we can make a difference in the community. My campaign is holding canvasses nearly every weekend and phone banks nearly every night. We have more than 600 people signed up as volunteers and almost 1000 donors – including nearly 700 who donated $250 or less.
  transitFunding: |
    We need a mayor that recognizes an effective partnership with Tri-Met is vital for meeting the needs of our citizens. As we look at preserving and enhancing transit service in the area, I want to work with Tri-Met to ensure that we have revenue necessary to support operations including securing more federal and state support.  We should examine options including adjusting SDCs, looking at the balance of resources going downtown vs underserved areas, and identifying possible new sources of revenue in collaboration with Tri-Met and other regional governments.
