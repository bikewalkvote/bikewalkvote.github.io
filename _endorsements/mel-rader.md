questionnaire_answers:
  safety: "The City of Portland should continue to request that ODOT make safety upgrades
    to urban arterials (a.k.a. Orphan Highways) and then hand over control to the
    City. This is true for 82nd Ave, Powell Boulevard, Barbur Boulevard, and others.
    Planning processes should engage local communities in helping to prioritize safety
    improvements and street crossings. For the Jade District area / 82nd Avenue, traffic
    should be slowed down, street crossings should be added, and the neighborhood
    should be made more walkable to be in line with the increasing urban neighborhood
    character of the Jade District.\n \nThe Powell-Division Transit Corridor Plan
    and the SW Corridor Plan both are exploring some exciting ways to transform these
    urban arterials. As population density increases, there is a great opportunity
    to put in high capacity rapid transit lines along Powell and Barbur Boulevards.
    Along with rapid transit, there needs to be additional safety features including
    more pedestrian crossings and bike paths in these corridors (although not necessarily
    on the urban arterials themselves).\n\nIn the 2015 legislative session, I advocated
    for House bill 3302 and Senate Bill 117 to raise the gas tax to pay for upgrades
    of urban arterials and to create a taskforce to prioritize which orphan highways
    should be transferred to City control. Unfortunately, these bills did not pass,
    but ODOT should still move forward with a plan to allocate funding for orphan
    highway upgrades and to prioritize the transfer to local control."
  visionZero: |-
    I believe that to achieve Vision Zero, we need to implement multiple complementary strategies to prevent injuries and fatalities. The primary strategy is to design streets with safety in mind. That means complete streets with good sidewalks and accessible bike paths. It also means creating a complete city-wide bicycle network that separates bicycles from motor vehicles as much as possible. Finally, it means good street crossings that are visible to drivers and stoplights to assist pedestrian crossings when needed.

    In order to implement these strategies, I believe we will need to shift more transportation dollars to East Portland and East Multnomah County which has been historically underfunded in transportation investments.

    Additional strategies include:
    Do a post mortem analysis of every fatality to identify the cause, and recommend a course of action that could have prevented the fatality
    Promote education campaigns to reduce drunk driving and other dangerous driving behaviors
    Invest in Safe Routes to Schools programs to create additional safety features when kids are present
    Consider lowering the speed limit or adding deterrents to speeding in areas with higher rates of collisions
    Conduct community outreach to encourage the development of neighborhood-level pedestrian and bicycle action plans

    As County Commissioner, I will seek to provide input on the Multnomah County Comprehensive Plan to help implement some of these features. I will also seek to incorporate these ideas into the design of any new bridge repairs and construction that falls into our jurisdiction. Finally, I will seek to be the lead commissioner that sits on the Metro Council’s transportation decision making body, JPACT.
  barriers: |-
    I share the belief of the Bicycle Transportation Alliance and others that Portland can be a world class city for bike infrastructure. In order to achieve this vision, we need to invest in high quality bike infrastructure and consistently create safety barriers between cars and bicycles. Diverters are one very effective tool to increase safety and comfort for bicyclists by separating bike traffic from cars, while still allowing pedestrian use.

    In addition, I believe that Multnomah County should be more of a leader in active transportation. The county can be a stronger voice on Metro’s JPACT committee.  The County can also provide more input on a number of City and Metro planning projects.

    Finally, I believe that the County should implement a carbon tax to pay for complete streets while ensuring that the policy supports economic justice for low-income communities by allocating tax revenue to programs that support critical services for low- and no-income populations.
  transportationCosts: |-
    I grew up in a low-income family, and most of my childhood, my family was too low-income to afford a car. I utilized buses, biking, and walking significantly growing up. Therefore, I strongly support investments in transportation options that better serve low-income families. That includes investments in transit options, safe bicycling infrastructure, and sidewalks. I also want to expand transit assistance programs to provide discounted or free transit passes to low-income families.

    I also believe we need to look closely at the impacts of any taxes on equity and redistribute funds to promote overall progressive tax policies. That means, I prefer taxation based on wealth over income and taxes on corporations over individuals. I remain supportive of taxes that are designed to shift behavior, such as gas taxes or congestion pricing, even though these are paid more by low-income individuals. However, I believe that we have an obligation to ensure that the overall package is a progressive package such that funds from these sources are used to benefit low-income families.

    One opportunity to raise funds while supporting equity is to create a transportation development charge. Using this model, new commercial developments in the county will pay into a transportation fund, and those funds are prioritized to benefit low-income individuals and families.
  sidewalks: "I believe we need a “fix it first” approach to transportation investments
    that prioritizes complete streets. I would support the creation of a county transportation
    investment fund using a source such as a development charge. This fund should
    be directed to repair current roads, fix bridges, and at every opportunity, create
    complete streets with good sidewalks and bike lanes.\n\nSidewalk infrastructure
    should go hand in hand with transit access points, which is why I would also support
    significant investments in sidewalks near new rapid transit lines. An example
    would be around the proposed Powell-Division Bus Rapid Transit proposal where
    planning for public and active transportation is happening at the same time. "
  accomplishments: |-
    I have been a transportation health advocate for 10 years. I was an early advocate of examining the public health impacts of transportation policy, and in 2007, I wrote an op-ed for The Portland Tribune (http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=91635) that makes the link between transportation planning and health.

    In 2009, I coordinated a Health Impact Assessment (HIA) looking at policies to reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled in Oregon. This was the first HIA in the country done on a climate change policy and has appeared as a model in three textbooks. It was highlighted as one of three “Trends in America” related to sustainable communities by the Council of State Governments.

    In 2010, I coordinated a health impact assessment on transportation policies in the “Eugene Climate and Energy Action Plan” (https://www.upstreampublichealth.org/resources/eugene-climate-and-energy-action-plan-hia). Also, in 2010, I secured funding to hire a full-time transportation policy coordinator and hired Heidi Guenin who has been a strong champion for transit, walking, and biking. She currently serves as the Executive Director of the Sustainable Transportation Council.

    Since 2010, my organization, Upstream Public Health, has done considerable work to promote healthy, active transportation options including:
    Secured $58.8 million for Connect Oregon VI in the 2015 legislative session
    Developed and built the Transportation Health Equity Network
    Developed and served as facilitator for the Transportation Justice Alliance
    Advocated as part of the Transportation for Oregon’s Future for more funding for Walking, Biking, and Public Transit
    Developed a rating system for transportation projects together with the Sustainable Transportation Council. Modeled after the LEEDS energy efficiency standards, we developed a framework for evaluating the impact on health and equity and published a 90 page report (https://www.upstreampublichealth.org/resources/safety-health-and-equity-credits-stars) on how to implement this rating system
    Identified strategies for Transportation Demand Management (i.e. reducing car use) (https://www.upstreampublichealth.org/resources/TDM_Report) for the Westside Transportation Alliance
    Developed Transportation Health Equity Principles (https://www.upstreampublichealth.org/resources/transportation-health-equity-principles) based on significant community input that was widely distributed to look at impacts of transportation policy
    Developed and conducted a full-day training on the health impacts of climate change policies including transportation, and presented the training to health departments around the country
    Contributed to the Multnomah County Climate Action Plan with input on the intersection between environmental protections and equity impacts

    In addition to the above organizational accomplishments (with me as the Executive Director), I also personally served on multiple committees and taskforces including:
    Trimet Equity and Access Advisory Committee
    Oregon League of Conservation Voters, Multnomah County Leadership Committee
    Oregon Conservation Network
    Advisor to the Oregon Climate Change and Health Resilience Plan committee
    Transportation for Oregon’s Future
    Oregon Health Equity Alliance (which helped secure multiple endorsements related to transportation policy)
  viability: I have the broadest base of support from any candidate with backers from
    the environmental community (Bob Stacey), the social justice community (Kayse
    Jama and Alberto Moreno), and the health community ( Sam Chase, Rede Group, and
    many individual healthcare providers). I entered the race later than other candidates,
    but I have already caught up to two candidates in fundraising, showing the most
    momentum of any candidate. I will also run a tight field operation and have the
    most significant and creative social media.
  transitFunding: |-
    I believe we need dedicated funding for transit operations, and this needs to be prioritized in state and local budget processes. As part of Transportation for Oregon’s Future, I advocated strongly for expanded state funding on public transit, walking and biking. In 2015, we were able to secure $58.8 million for Connect Oregon VI, bringing some additional much-needed funding for transit, walking, and biking. But the need for additional money for transit operations is still much greater than this.

    At the local level, unfortunately, gas taxes can not be used for transit.  However, we can still put forward a transportation-related development fee such that whenever there is a new commercial development, the county could charge a fee based on the transportation needs for the development. Using that approach, funding could be used to support transit operations, walking and biking.

    Another option to raise additional funds is a carbon tax system. This would include raising fees on gas, electricity, and other key sources of carbon emissions. The gas tax would be used to repair roads, repair bridges, and create “complete streets” with sidewalks and bike baths. The electricity tax could be used to pay for transit operations, and also provide a rebate to low income families living in the county in order to offset the cost of the tax for the lowest income bracket.
